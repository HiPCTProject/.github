# HiP-CT Project

This organisation contains codes used internally within the HiP-CT project.

Where possible we've made these codes public so others can read and re-use.
None of the code is designed to be general purpose or scientist-facing.

For public-facing codes for working with HiP-CT data in the [Human Organ Atlas](https://human-organ-atlas.esrf.eu/), see https://github.com/HumanOrganAtlas.
