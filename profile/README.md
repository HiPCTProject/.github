# HiP-CT Project

This organisation contains codes used internally within the HiP-CT project.

Where possible we've made these codes public in case any of it is useful to those external to the project.
None of the code is designed to be general purpose or scientist-facing however.

For public-facing codes for working with HiP-CT data in the [Human Organ Atlas](https://human-organ-atlas.esrf.eu/), see https://github.com/HumanOrganAtlas.
